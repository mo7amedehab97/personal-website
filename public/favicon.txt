Creating a favicon for your website:

1. Use an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, or an online service like favicon.io
2. Create a square image (ideally 512x512 pixels)
3. Save it as favicon.ico in the public directory
4. Also create multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 180x180, 192x192, 512x512

For a quick solution, you can convert your profile picture or logo to a favicon using:

After generating, place all the files in the public directory.
